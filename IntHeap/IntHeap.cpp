// PURPOSE: C++ class implementation for a heap (data structure)
//  containing ints.  Smallest value is at the "top" of the heap.

#include "IntHeap.hpp"

// adds a node to the heap. Returns true if successful, false otherwise. 
bool
IntHeap::add(int newVal)
{
  // if there is no room left in the heap, then adding is not
  // possible.
  // i.e. if the last addition ended up putting a node in
  // the last slot of the array, there's no room left for another
  // value.
  if (_lastIndex>=_size)
    return false;

  // we've got one more element in the heap ...
  _lastIndex++;

  // store that element in the next open slot ...
  _values[_lastIndex]=newVal;

  // ... but that may not be the right place to put this new value, so
  // upheap the node until it is in the right place.
  upHeap(_lastIndex);

  // if we get here, evrything went fine. 
  return true;
}

// remove the min value from the heap (ie. the "root")
int
IntHeap::removeMin()
{
  // get the min value;
  int mval = _values[1];

  // we are removing something, so "move" the last element to the root ...
  _values[1] = _values[_lastIndex];
  // ... and remember that we now have one fewer element in the heap. 
  _lastIndex--;

  // unfortunately, the element we just moved to the top/root is probably
  // not the new min value. Keep pushing it down the heap (from the
  // root) until it is appropriately re-located.
  downHeap(1);

  //return the min value
